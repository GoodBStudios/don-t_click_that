# Recover Together — Production Build

This package contains a production-ready static website:
- HTML pages: index.html, resources.html, journal.html, about.html, settings.html
- minified CSS under /css
- modular JS under /js
- small SVG favicon in /assets

How to use:
- Upload the entire folder to any static host (GitHub Pages, Netlify).
- Or open index.html locally to try it out.

Privacy note:
- All user data is stored in localStorage under key `rt_data_v2`.
- IBAN is stored locally — avoid asking visitors to post bank details publicly.
